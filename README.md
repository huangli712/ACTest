# ACTest

The `ACTest` toolkit implements a spectral function / correlation function generator in Juila. It can generate multiple datasets for various spectral functions automatically. In addition, the corresponding imaginary time or Matsubara Green's functions (or the other correlation functions) with artifical Gaussian noises are also generated. It provides some useful scripts to perform extensive analytic continuation calculations and analyze the benchmark results. Now it is interfaced with the `ACFlow` toolkit. But interfaced with the other analytic continuation methods or tools are also straightforward.

This toolkit is currently under developement. **PLEASE USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!**
