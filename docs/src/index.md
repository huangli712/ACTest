# ACTest

*A testing toolkit for analytic continuation methods and codes*

!!! info

    Thank you for using ACTest. This documentation will help you to be familiar with and explore the ACTest toolkit. It is just compatible with ACTest v1.1.6-devel.250627.

!!! note

    Analytic continuation is an art of optimization. Please check your simulated results carefully.

!!! warning

    The ACTest toolkit is in heavy development. Please use it at your own risk. If you encounter any bugs or troubles, or require new features, please consult me directly: **huangli at caep.cn**
