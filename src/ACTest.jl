    ACTest

ACTest is an automatical generator for fermionic or bosonic correlation
functions. It is used to generate a lot of correlators and corresponding
spectral functions. They are then employed to benchmark the analytic
continuation methods or tools.

Now ACTest is used together with the ACFlow toolkit. But it is easily to
be interfaced with the other analytic continuation codes.

For more details about how to obtain, install and use the ACTest toolkit,
please visit the following website:

* `https://huangli712.github.io/projects/actest/index.html`

Any suggestions, comments, and feedbacks are welcome. Enjoy it!
